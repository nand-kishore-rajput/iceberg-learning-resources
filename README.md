# Apache Iceberg Learning Resources Repository
Hello and welcome to my comprehensive collection of Apache Iceberg learning materials. This repository is designed to be a centralized resource for anyone looking to learn or deepen their knowledge of Apache Iceberg, regardless of their experience level.
## What You'll Find Here
This collection encompasses a wide range of materials organized by and suited to different learning preferences and skill levels. From in-depth guides and documentation to interactive exercises, I've gathered resources to cater to a variety of needs.
## Contributing to the Collection
If you have a resource that could benefit others in their understanding of Apache Iceberg, I encourage you to contribute. To submit a resource, please [open an issue](https://github.com/pmoskovi/iceberg-learning-resources/issues) in the following format:
*  Name: Title of the resource.
* Link: URL or location of the resource.
* Description: A brief summary of the resource.
* Source: The origin or creator of the resource.
* Skill Level: [Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced].
* Resource Type: [Video, Documentation, Guide or Tutorial, Blog Post, Book or Article, FAQ, Newsletter].
* Interactivity: [Hands-on Exercise, Quiz or Test, Community Forum].
* Language: [Java, Python, .NET, Go, JavaScript, Other].

I regularly review submissions to ensure the repository remains up-to-date and valuable for learners at all levels.

## How I Manage the Resources
To keep things organized and easily accessible, I've implemented a simple, streamlined process. All the resources are stored in an [AirTable spreadsheet](https://airtable.com/appB6ToN0rvzHmNER/shrqXlHOBY51QTBeq/), which acts as the central hub for all the content. This approach allows me to maintain and update the resources efficiently. Whenever there's a change in the contents of the spreadsheet, a script is executed to update this very README.md page. This process ensures that the information you see on this page is current and reflects the contents of the [AirTable spreadsheet](https://airtable.com/appB6ToN0rvzHmNER/shrqXlHOBY51QTBeq/).

Your input and participation are what make this repository a valuable resource for everyone. If you have any questions or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out. It is my goal to ensure that this repository remains a top-notch resource for Apache Iceberg knowledge.
Thank you for visiting and contributing to this collaborative effort. Together, we can make learning Apache Iceberg accessible and effective for everyone.

 Happy Learning!
